# SentimentClassifier
It is a Classification Model which classifies the sentiments(positive/negative) for the toys given in the dataset.It consists of two models, one has the results based on the ratings while the other based on the words that are present in the review written for the given toy using text analysis. In this I used turicreate library for data exploration, analysis as well as building of the model.
